#PROJECT PROPOSAL
'''
I intend to create a program that essentially reads braille from a web camera and converts it into text
All other features should be based on this particular feature (mode that allows u to practice reading braille/writing and comphrehending it)
Naturally this term project will require the use of opencv as well as numpy. I intend to first have a framework with by using many builtin opencv function
hoping to eventually code my own but getting it to function is priority. I chose this particular problem bc i thought it would be 
cool to learn braille and get some perspective to how those who cannot see interact with the world hoping that others would  have the same sentiment
As for the specific user interface I think tkinter should be sufficient since most of the user interface would be with either simple keyboard instructions
and webcamera which is covered by opencv. The program will also be mostly text so "fancy" graphics arent used

#COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
'''
So far the closest program to this idea would be one "http://www.mattvenn.net/2014/02/08/using-a-computer-to-read-braille/"
that essentially uses opencv to read braille. The key difference between what I intend to do and what he did is that I will not be using as much hardware
to detect the braille and instead of utilizing pins my program will read a piece of paper with colored dots, filled for "bump" and unfilled outline for
"unfilled". there are also online text to braille translators that take keystrokes and converts it into braille images. I will be implementing something similar
in my program.

#experimental code
im=cv2.imread('test5.png')
im_gray=cv2.cvtColor(im,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
template=cv2.imread('unfilledtest1.png',0)
width,height=template.shape[::-1]
res=cv2.matchTemplate(im_gray,template,cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)
threhold=0.3
loc=np.where(res>=threhold)
for pt in zip(*loc[::-1]):
    cv2.rectangle(im,pt,(pt[0]+width,pt[1]+height),(0,255,255),0)
cv2.imshow('1',im)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
